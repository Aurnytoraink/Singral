Since my TIDAL free trial account expire soon. I can't focus on the project anymore. So for now, I will keep my Tidal code but I will make a new branch for Qobuz.
I still don't know the future of the app. Will I make two seperate client or one app that supports both. 

# QobuzGTK

A Qobuz client for GNOME environment
